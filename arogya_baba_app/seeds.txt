Chia seeds pack a major nutritional punch. A tablespoon contains 69 calories, largely thanks to the seeds’ heart-healthy fats, plus 5.5 grams of fiber. It’s no surprise they make a welcome addition to everything from smoothies to make-ahead puddings.

Like their cousins, chia seeds, flax seeds are diverse little kernels. A tablespoon has 55 calories, 3 grams of fiber, and 4 grams of good-for-you fats. Add them to smoothies, sprinkle them atop your morning bowl of cereal, or incorporate them into your baking when you want a healthy dessert.
