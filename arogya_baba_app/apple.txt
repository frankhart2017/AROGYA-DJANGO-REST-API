Apples' skin offers a good dose of filling fiber, which can help you take in fewer calories overall. One medium apple serves up 4 grams of the nutrient. Plus, the antioxidants in apples may help prevent metabolic syndrome, a condition that can increase your risk for heart disease, along with other health issues like obesity. 100 grams of the fruit gives 52 calories.
Apples are the ideal on-the-go low-calorie snack. For a pie-like treat, chop up a medium apple and sprinkle with allspice and cinnamon, then pop it in the microwave for 1 1/2 minutes.
