Almonds are an excellent source of fiber, and they're high in protein. Eating foods with the one-two punch of fiber and protein can help you feel fuller longer—which makes it less tempting to reach for an unhealthy snack between meals. Rich in vitamin E and a good source of heart-healthy mono- and polyunsaturated fats, almonds are a great choice to sprinkle over a salad or side dish. You can also use them in pesto in place of walnuts or pine nuts, top your morning granola with them, or simply keep a small bag in your purse as an emergency snack. 100g of almonds at a time give 576 calories of energy along with 49g of fat, 22g of carbs which comprise of 12g dietary fiber, and 21g of protein.
