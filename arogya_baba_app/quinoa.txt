Quinoa is the seed of the plant Chenopodium quinoa.  It is native to South America. It is high in many nutrients, and is often referred to as a "superfood." Quinoa is actually not a grain, but a pseudo-cereal, a seed that is prepared and consumed like a grain. However, quinoa is higher in nutrients than most grains. It is also gluten-free, so it can be enjoyed by individuals who are sensitive to gluten orÂ wheat. Quinoa seeds are flat, oval-shaped and usually pale yellow, but the color can range from pink to black, and the taste can vary from bitter to sweet. It is usually boiled and consumed as a side dish, as breakfast porridge, added to salads, or used to thicken soups. The seeds can also be sprouted, ground and used as flour, or they can be popped like popcorn. Quinoa is an excellent food for babies. The year 2013 was designated "The International Year of Quinoa" by the United Nations,  because of its potential to contribute to food security worldwide. Even though quinoa technically isn't a grain, it still counts as a "whole grain" food. It has 120 calories and it consists of 4.4g of protein, 21.3g carbs out of which 0.9g is sugar, 2.8g of fiber and 1.9g of fat. Quinoa is relatively high in protein compared to other grains, and provides all the essential amino acids.
