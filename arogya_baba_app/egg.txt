Some eggs are laid by female animals of many different species, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and fish, and have been eaten by humans for thousands of years. Bird and reptile eggs consist of a protective eggshell, albumen (egg white), and vitellus (egg yolk), contained within various thin membranes. The most commonly consumed eggs are chicken eggs. Other poultry eggs including those of duck and quail also are eaten. Fish eggs are called roe and caviar. Eggs contain multiple proteins that gel at different temperatures within the yolk and the white, and the temperature determines the gelling time. It has 6.3g of protein, 0.6g of carbs and 5g of fat. It has 86 calories. In essence, there are two parts of an egg which are distinctly different from each other: the yolk and the white. Adults with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop heart disease or stroke than nondiabetic adults. One can eat as many egg whites as possible.
